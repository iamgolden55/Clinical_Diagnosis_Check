# EleraAI Healthcare Assistant Upgrade Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to enhance the EleraAI Healthcare Assistant to make it more engaging, culturally relevant, and continuously improving. As an AI healthcare assistant focused on African regions, these improvements will make the system more effective at addressing user needs within the appropriate cultural context.

## 1. Enhanced Conversation Flow

### 1.1 Dynamic Follow-up Questions ✅
- **Implementation**: Modify the AI response generation to include follow-up questions based on the user's initial complaint. ✅
- **Example Flow**:
  - User: "I have been having stomach pain for two days."
  - AI: "I understand you're experiencing stomach pain. This could be caused by several factors including indigestion, food poisoning, or gastritis. Can you tell me if you're experiencing any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or fever? Also, did the pain start after eating anything unusual?"

### 1.2 Context Preservation
- **Implementation**: Enhance the chat state management to retain important medical information shared earlier in the conversation.
- **Task**: Create a context management system that tracks:
  - Symptoms mentioned
  - Duration of symptoms
  - Previous treatments tried
  - User's medical background when shared

### 1.3 Medical Analysis Flow ✅
- **Implementation**: Create structured conversation flows for common medical complaints. ✅
- **Example**:
  1. Initial symptom assessment
  2. Follow-up on symptom details (duration, severity, triggers)
  3. Questions about related symptoms
  4. Questions about attempted remedies
  5. Preliminary assessment and recommendations
  6. Follow-up plan or referral guidance

## 2. Cultural Relevance & Localization

### 2.1 Traditional Medicine Integration ✅
- **Implementation**: Train the model to appropriately ask about and respond to mentions of traditional remedies. ✅
- **Example Questions**:
  - "Have you tried any traditional or herbal remedies for this condition?"
  - "Some people in your region might use [specific remedy]. Have you considered this, or has it been recommended to you?"

### 2.2 Cultural Context Awareness ✅
- **Implementation**: Enhance the model's understanding of cultural health beliefs and practices across different African regions. ✅
- **Features**:
  - Region-specific health practice recognition
  - Appropriate responses that bridge traditional and modern medical approaches
  - Sensitivity to cultural beliefs about certain conditions

### 2.3 Multilingual Improvement ✅
- **Implementation**: Enhance the existing language support with more culturally appropriate phrasings. ✅
- **Tasks**:
  - Improve Nigerian Pidgin responses with more authentic expressions ✅
  - Develop better context for other local languages (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa) ✅
  - Include region-specific medical terminology ✅

## 3. Feedback & Continuous Learning System

### 3.1 User Feedback Collection ✅
- **Implementation**: Add an explicit feedback mechanism to gather data for model improvement. ✅
- **Features**:
  - Simple rating system (1-5 stars) after each conversation ✅
  - Optional detailed feedback submission ✅
  - Specific feedback on cultural relevance and accuracy ✅
  - Button to flag misinformation or concerning responses ✅

### 3.2 Data Pipeline for Model Training
- **Implementation**: Develop a system to collect, analyze, and utilize conversation data for model improvement.
- **Components**:
  - Anonymous conversation logging with user consent ✅
  - Feedback classification system
  - Regular analysis reports to identify areas for improvement
  - Data preparation pipeline for model fine-tuning

### 3.3 Expert Review System
- **Implementation**: Establish a process for healthcare professionals to review and provide input on the AI's responses.
- **Process**:
  - Regular sampling of conversations for expert review
  - Classification of response quality and accuracy
  - Recommendations for improvement
  - Integration of expert knowledge into training data

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Backend Updates

#### 4.1.1 Prompt Engineering ✅
- Update the OpenAI prompt template in `backend/api/views.py` to include: ✅
  - Instructions for follow-up questions ✅
  - Cultural context guidelines ✅
  - Emphasis on identifying when to ask about traditional remedies ✅
  - Guidelines for when to acknowledge limits of knowledge ✅

```python
# Example prompt template update
CHAT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are EleraAI, a healthcare assistant specializing in providing medical information for users in African regions.

When responding to health concerns:
1. Provide clear, helpful medical information
2. Ask follow-up questions to better understand the user's condition
3. Inquire about both modern and traditional remedies they might have tried
4. Be sensitive to cultural contexts around health
5. Clearly state when a condition requires professional medical attention
6. Acknowledge when you don't have enough information rather than guessing

Current conversation:
{conversation_history}

User: {user_message}

Your response should include relevant medical information AND at least one follow-up question to gather more context:
"""
```

#### 4.1.2 Context Management
- Create a new `UserContext` class to track and manage medical information shared in the conversation
- Implement extraction of key medical entities and their relationships
- Develop logic to determine when to ask about traditional remedies

### 4.2 Frontend Updates

#### 4.2.1 Feedback Interface ✅
- Add a feedback component to the UI that appears after each assistant response ✅
- Implement a star rating system with optional comment field ✅
- Add a "Was this culturally appropriate?" checkbox ✅

#### 4.2.2 UI Enhancements
- Update the transcript display to better organize the conversation flow
- Add visual indicators for follow-up questions to encourage user responses
- Implement an optional "health context" sidebar that shows the system's understanding of the user's condition
