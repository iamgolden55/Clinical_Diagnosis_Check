# EleraAI Transformation Plan: Text-Based to Live Voice Conversation

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to transform EleraAI from a text-based healthcare assistant to a real-time voice conversation system using LiveKit, speech recognition, and text-to-speech technologies.

## Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure (LiveKit) ✅
- [x] 1.1 Set up LiveKit server or use LiveKit Cloud (LiveKit integration configured)
- [x] 1.2 Generate API keys and configure environment (Environment configuration updated)
- [x] 1.3 Create authentication system for LiveKit rooms (Token generation implemented)
- [x] 1.4 Set up backend LiveKit integration (Core service created)

## Phase 2: Backend Voice Services ✅
- [x] 2.1 Create Django app for voice services (voice_service app created)
- [x] 2.2 Implement database models for voice sessions, participants, and transcripts
- [x] 2.3 Set up API endpoints for voice session management
- [x] 2.4 Configure Text-to-Speech service with ElevenLabs
- [x] 2.5 Configure Speech-to-Text service with OpenAI Whisper API

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ✅
- [x] 3.1 Install LiveKit SDK and dependencies
- [x] 3.2 Create UI components for real-time voice interaction
- [x] 3.3 Implement microphone access and audio streaming
- [x] 3.4 Set up audio playback for assistant responses
- [x] 3.5 Create a voice activity detector to handle when a user is speaking
- [x] 3.6 Implement mute/unmute controls
- [x] 3.7 Add visual indicators for active speaker and audio status

## Phase 4: Real-time Processing Pipeline ✅
- [x] 4.1 Implement client-side audio processing
- [x] 4.2 Create streaming transcription mechanism
- [x] 4.3 Configure real-time text-to-speech synthesis
- [x] 4.4 Add support for different languages and accents
- [x] 4.5 Implement language detection for automatic switching
- [x] 4.6 Optimize latency for real-time conversation

## Phase 5: Language Model Integration ✅
- [x] 5.1 Connect real-time transcription to LLM
- [x] 5.2 Implement LLM response streaming
- [x] 5.3 Configure LLM for conversation context preservation
- [x] 5.4 Add support for different language prompts
- [x] 5.5 Implement voice-specific LLM instructions

## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
- [ ] 6.1 Test full conversation flow
- [ ] 6.2 Optimize audio quality and latency
- [ ] 6.3 Test with different languages
- [ ] 6.4 Implement error handling for audio/connection issues
- [ ] 6.5 Performance testing and optimization

## Phase 7: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] 7.1 Add visual feedback for speech recognition
- [ ] 7.2 Implement visual turn-taking cues
- [ ] 7.3 Create visual assistant persona
- [ ] 7.4 Add accessibility features
- [ ] 7.5 Implement responsive design for different devices

## Phase 8: Deployment and Production Readiness
- [ ] 8.1 Configure production environment
- [ ] 8.2 Set up LiveKit server or cloud account
- [ ] 8.3 Implement security measures for production
- [ ] 8.4 Add monitoring and logging for voice services
- [ ] 8.5 Create deployment documentation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Voice Flow
```
User Speaks → Microphone → LiveKit Stream → Backend ASR → LLM → TTS → LiveKit Stream → User Hears
```

### Backend Services
1. **LiveKit Server**: Handles WebRTC streaming for audio
2. **ASR Service**: Converts speech to text (streaming)
3. **LLM Processor**: Existing ChatOpenAI pipeline with voice-optimized prompts
4. **TTS Service**: Converts text to natural speech (streaming)
5. **Session Manager**: Maintains conversation context across voice segments

### Dependencies
- LiveKit Server/Cloud
- ASR Provider (Whisper, Google, etc.)
- TTS Provider (ElevenLabs, Google, etc.)
- WebRTC-capable frontend
- Streaming-capable backend

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 days ✅
- Phase 2: 3-4 days ✅
- Phase 3: 3-4 days ✅
- Phase 4: 2-3 days ✅
- Phase 5: 2-3 days ✅
- Phase 6: 2-3 days
- Phase 7: 1-2 days
- Phase 8: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 2-3 weeks for full implementation
