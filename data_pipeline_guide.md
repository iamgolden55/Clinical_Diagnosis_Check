# EleraAI Data Pipeline Guide

## Introduction

This document explains how the EleraAI data pipeline works, from collecting user feedback to generating training data for model improvement. Understanding this pipeline is crucial for maintaining and enhancing the AI's performance, particularly in healthcare contexts where accuracy and cultural appropriateness are essential.

## System Architecture Overview

EleraAI uses a comprehensive feedback-driven approach to continuously improve the model:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Captures user interactions, feedback, and expert reviews
2. **Processing Layer**: Extracts metrics, identifies patterns, and structures data
3. **Analytics Layer**: Visualizes metrics and identifies improvement areas
4. **Training Data Generation**: Prepares high-quality data for model fine-tuning

## Data Collection Process

### User Feedback

The system collects several types of feedback from users:

- **Ratings**: Numerical ratings (1-5) for AI responses
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Boolean flag indicating if responses were culturally appropriate
- **Comments**: Text feedback describing issues or suggestions
- **User Context**: Medical symptoms, treatments tried, and cultural preferences

### Expert Reviews

Healthcare professionals can review AI responses and provide specialized feedback:

- **Medical Accuracy**: Ratings for clinical correctness
- **Cultural Relevance**: Assessments of cultural appropriateness
- **Suggested Corrections**: Expert-provided alternatives to AI responses
- **Additional Notes**: Context-specific observations

### Conversation Data

The system stores:

- Complete chat histories
- User queries and AI responses
- User context details maintained throughout conversations

## Data Processing Pipeline

### The DataPipeline Class

The core of the system is the `DataPipeline` class in `data_pipeline.py`. It provides methods for:

```python
# Main methods
extract_metrics()       # Processes feedback to derive insights
prepare_training_data() # Generates datasets for model training
update_analytics_metrics() # Updates database with new metrics
```

### Metrics Extraction

The system automatically extracts metrics including:

- Average rating scores
- Cultural appropriateness percentages
- Feedback volume over time
- Common issues identified in comments

Example of how metrics are extracted:

```python
# Extract average ratings
avg_rating = feedback_data.aggregate(avg=Avg('rating'))

# Calculate cultural appropriateness score
cultural_count = feedback_data.filter(culturally_appropriate=True).count()
cultural_score = (cultural_count / total_feedback_count) * 100

# Identify common issues through keyword extraction
issue_keywords = {
    'cultural_relevance': ['cultural', 'tradition', 'local', 'belief'],
    'medical_accuracy': ['wrong', 'incorrect', 'accurate', 'inaccurate'],
    # Additional categories...
}
```

### Data Aggregation

Metrics are aggregated at different time scales:

- **Daily metrics**: Fine-grained view of performance
- **Weekly metrics**: Medium-term trends
- **Monthly metrics**: Long-term performance assessment

The system also aggregates by language preference to monitor performance across different language settings.

## Training Data Generation

### Creating Training Datasets

The pipeline generates structured training data by:

1. Filtering feedback based on rating thresholds (typically 4-5 stars)
2. Associating conversation history with feedback
3. Including user context information
4. Adding expert reviews when available

Example training data structure:

```json
{
  "feedback_id": 123,
  "conversation": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I have a headache for 3 days", "timestamp": "2023-06-01T10:45:23"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry to hear about your headache...", "timestamp": "2023-06-01T10:45:30"}
  ],
  "user_context": {
    "symptoms": {"headache": {"name": "headache", "severity": 4}},
    "symptom_durations": {"headache": "3 days"},
    "treatments_tried": [{"name": "Paracetamol", "type": "modern", "effective": false}]
  },
  "feedback": {
    "rating": 4,
    "culturally_appropriate": true,
    "comment": "Good advice but didn't mention traditional remedies"
  },
  "expert_reviews": [
    {
      "reviewer_name": "Dr. Smith",
      "medical_accuracy": 5,
      "cultural_relevance": 3,
      "suggested_correction": "Could mention local herb treatments as alternatives"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Data Filtering Strategies

You can filter training data based on several criteria:

- **Minimum rating threshold**: Focus on highly-rated responses
- **Date range**: Train on recent data or specific time periods
- **Presence of expert reviews**: Prioritize expert-validated data
- **Language**: Filter by language preference

## Using the Data Pipeline

### Through the Web Interface

The Data Pipeline Manager in the frontend provides a user-friendly interface to:

1. **Run pipeline operations**:
   - Update analytics metrics
   - Generate training data

2. **Set parameters**:
   - Date ranges
   - Minimum rating thresholds
   - Additional filtering criteria

3. **View results**:
   - Available datasets
   - Pipeline operation statistics
   - Current metrics

### Using API Endpoints

You can also trigger pipeline operations programmatically:

```bash
# Update metrics
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/data-pipeline/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation": "update_metrics", "from_date": "2023-05-01", "to_date": "2023-06-01"}'

# Generate training data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/data-pipeline/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation": "generate_training", "min_rating": 4}'
```

## Regular Model Training Workflow

Follow this workflow for continuous model improvement:

1. **Collect feedback**: Ensure users and experts provide regular feedback
2. **Process data weekly**: Run the pipeline to update metrics
3. **Generate training data monthly**: Create new datasets focusing on high-quality samples
4. **Analyze metrics**: Identify areas for improvement
5. **Fine-tune model**: Use the generated datasets to retrain the model
6. **Evaluate improvements**: Compare performance before and after training
7. **Deploy updated model**: Roll out improvements to users

### Example Schedule

| Frequency | Task | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Daily | Review feedback | Quick issue identification |
| Weekly | Update metrics | Track performance trends |
| Monthly | Generate training data | Prepare for model updates |
| Quarterly | Major model fine-tuning | Significant performance improvements |

## Best Practices for Data Quality

1. **Balance data across demographics**:
   - Ensure representation across cultural backgrounds
   - Include diverse medical conditions and symptoms
   - Balance language preferences

2. **Prioritize expert-reviewed data**:
   - Expert validation improves training quality
   - Focus on samples where expert and user ratings align

3. **Filter for high-quality samples**:
   - Use minimum rating thresholds (typically 4+)
   - Include some lower-rated samples for learning from mistakes
   - Prioritize feedback with detailed comments

4. **Address data drift**:
   - Regularly update training data to include recent patterns
   - Monitor performance across time periods

## Monitoring and Analytics

The Analytics Dashboard provides insights into:

- Average rating trends
- Cultural appropriateness scores
- Feedback volume
- Common issues identified

Use these metrics to:
- Identify areas for model improvement
- Track progress over time
- Detect emerging issues
- Validate the impact of model updates

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Potential Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Low feedback volume | Implement more prominent feedback requests |
| Declining ratings | Review and update model training with recent data |
| Cultural issues | Include more diverse training samples |
| Data quality problems | Increase expert review coverage |

## Conclusion

The EleraAI data pipeline is designed for continuous improvement through user feedback and expert validation. By regularly collecting, processing, and utilizing this data, the system can adapt to user needs and provide increasingly accurate and culturally appropriate healthcare information.

Remember that the quality of the model ultimately depends on the quality of the data used for training. Maintaining a robust feedback collection process and regular pipeline operation is essential for long-term success.
